# Actuarial Experience Studies and Assumption Setting in R

## New York R Conference 2022

### June 9, 2022

Slides and R Code used for the presentation "Actuarial Experience Studies and Assumption Setting in R" from the 2022 NYR Conference

To follow the examples used in the presentation, run the following scripts in this order:

- Create simulation data: `simulate_data.R`
- Run a simplified experience study and generate assumptions with and without predictive models: `model.R`
- Create a quick variable importance plot: `vip.R`
- Assess performance using an actuarial model: `actuary.R`

After running each script, it's recommended you reset your R environment.

The scripts `assumptions.R` and `expact.R` don't need to be run separately. They're always sourced when needed.
